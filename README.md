# A multi-fidelity GP for code calibration


Most of the codes would be the same as matter_multi_fidelity_emu.

But during the development phase, there might be some new features be designed.

Current to-do list:

1. Load stellar mass functions
2. Find the corresponding cosmological parameters
3. Apply MF on 3 sims and test on 1 sim; do the cross-validation.
4. Sims probably not enough; propose new locations to run sims.
